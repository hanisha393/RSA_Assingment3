Assignment-3

Problem Statement:
Perform direct RSA and optimized RSA, then calculate the time differece between direct RSA decyption and optimized RSA decryption.

Solution:

1.Generate p,q prime numbers randomly
2.Calculate N=p*q and phi=(p-1)*(q-1)
3.Select e such that it is co-prime to phi
4.Calculate d which is inverse of e w.r.t phi
5.We have public key:(N,e) and private key:(p,q,d)
6.Calculating xp,xq required for optimized decryption, they are irrespective of message m, so they can be calculated at once
  i.Finding xp,xq
    1.Calculate p_inverse w.r.t q and q_inverse w.r.t p
    2.Calculate xp = q*(q_inverse w.r.t p)
    3.Calculate xq = p*(p_inverse w.r.t q)

I.Encyption
  Encyption is same for direct and optimized RSA
  c = pow(m,e)%N

II.Decryption
  a.Direct
    m = pow(c,d)%N

  b.Optimized
    m = ((xp*vp) + (xq*vq))%N
    vp,vq are message dependent so they have to be calculated for each decryption
    ii.Finding vp,vq
       1.Calculate c1 = c%p, c2=c%q
       2.Calculate d1 = d%(p-1), d2 = d%(q-1)
       3.Calculate vp = pow(c1,d1)%p
       4.Calculate vq = pow(c2,d2)%q
